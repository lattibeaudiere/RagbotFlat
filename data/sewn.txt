SEWN Project Overview
SEWN is a blockchain-based survey app using the Sui blockchain. It empowers 
Black and underrepresented communities by rewarding participants with crypto, 
while giving them data ownership. It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
to generate insights and offer personalized feedback from survey data. Walrus
is used as the database layer, and Seal handles encryption.
